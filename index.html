                    <p>
                        The National Society of Black Engineers is an organization
                        founded to help young black engineers succeed at the collegiate
                        level and to eventually lead succesful careers as engineers.
                        With that, NSBE members are tasked with not only fulfilling that,
                        but to also give back to the community with their service, resources,
                        and knowledge.
