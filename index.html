                <h2>What is NSBE?</h2>
                <p>
                    The National Society of Black Engineers is an organization
                    founded to help young black engineers succeed at the collegiate
                    level and to eventually lead succesful careers as engineers.
                    With that, NSBE members are tasked with not only fulfilling that,
                    but to also give back to the community with their service, resources,
                    and knowledge.

                    The first major trip I took with my chapter to St. Louis.
                    I learned a lot about NSBE and life after college.
